*****Confusion Matrix*******


1 1
2 2

It is a table that is used in classification problems 
to assess where errors in the model were made.

The rows represent the actual classes the outcomes 
should have been. While the columns represent the 
predictions we have made. Using this table it is 
easy to see which predictions are wrong.



Confusion matrixes can be created by 
predictions made from a
 logistic regression.
 
 
E.g: 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy
from sklearn import metrics

actual = numpy.random.binomial(1,.9,size = 1000)
predicted = numpy.random.binomial(1,.9,size = 1000)

confusion_matrix = metrics.confusion_matrix(actual, predicted)

cm_display = metrics.ConfusionMatrixDisplay(confusion_matrix = confusion_matrix, display_labels = [False, True])

cm_display.plot()
plt.show()
